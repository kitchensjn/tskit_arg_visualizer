I created `out.1000.arg` on the University of California, Davis FARM cluster by following instructions from the electronic supplementary material from https://doi.org/10.1007/978-1-0716-0199-0_10. This is just one of the ARGs sampled by `argweaver`.

In `view.py`, I subset the ARG to trees around FY*O at 159174683 and visualized the ARG after simplifying only to nodes that affected the topology. Nodes needed to be dragged to more optimal positions after the force-directed simulation settled.
